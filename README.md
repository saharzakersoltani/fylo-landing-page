# Fylo Landing Page

Welcome to the **Fylo Landing Page** project! This is a front-end development project aimed at creating a visually appealing and functional landing page for Fylo, a fictional company. The project is based on a design challenge from **Frontend Mentor**, a platform that provides real-world coding challenges to help developers improve their skills.

## Project Overview

The Fylo Landing Page is a static webpage designed to showcase the services and features of Fylo. The page includes sections such as a hero section, feature highlights, testimonials, and a call-to-action (CTA) section. The design is clean and modern, with a focus on user experience.

- **Feature Highlights**: Key features of Fylo's offerings, presented in an easy-to-read format.
- **Testimonials**: Customer testimonials to build trust and credibility.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: A clear and compelling CTA to encourage user engagement.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, including custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent theming.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project hosting.
